# ChurnPredictRetainAI

This repository contains an AI-powered solution for predicting customer churn and generating personalized retention strategies. It combines machine learning, NLP, and generative AI to understand and address customer dissatisfaction.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical business challenge of customer churn by developing a comprehensive system that:

* **Predicts Churn:** Utilizes machine learning models to identify customers at risk of leaving.
* **Analyzes Customer Feedback:** Employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights from customer feedback and understand reasons for dissatisfaction.
* **Generates Retention Strategies:** Leverages Generative AI to create personalized retention plans and communication strategies.
* **Chatbot:** Implements a chatbot for user queries and response generation.

## Key Components

* **Data Understanding and Preprocessing:**
    * Exploration and cleaning of customer data.
    * Feature engineering for improved model performance.
* **Predictive Models:**
    * Implementation and comparison of machine learning models for churn prediction.
    * Identification of key factors influencing churn.
* **NLP for Sentiment Analysis:**
    * Preprocessing of textual customer feedback.
    * Sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction.
    * Extraction of key dissatisfaction points.
* **Generative AI for Retention:**
    * Generation of personalized retention strategies.
    * Creation of tailored communication plans.
    * Chatbot implementation.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk transformers torch
    ```
    (add any other library that you used)
3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Open and execute the provided Jupyter Notebook (`your_notebook_name.ipynb`) to explore the solution.

## Dataset

* The dataset used for this project is included in the repository. Please review the data description within the notebook for details on its structure and features.

## UsageR

* The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding the data, building the models, and generating retention strategies.
* The chatbot can be implemented by running the relevant code cells in the notebook.

## Future Improvements

* Integration with real-time customer data streams.
* Advanced fine tuning of the generative AI model.
* Deployment of the chatbot as a web service.
* A/B testing of different generated retention strategies.
